### Favorite CPSC 120L LABS

* Lab 7

    Lab 7 part 1, was a very complex lab for me and other students at the time because of the & and ! that were included within the parking rules. Being introduced to new concepts of using if statements was not easy but this lab had us use if statements in a way to figure out the parking time issue. But because of this difficulty it taught me how to go through the failure me and my partner had and decipher code in a way to figure out the problems. Although through this i enjoyed the struggle of going back and forth through the lab because of the work I had to put into it.

* Lab 6

	Lab 6 part 1, was an interesting lab that was more interesting and fun than most because of how much work there was outside of coding throughout the lecture because we would talk about what makes a sandwich a sandwich. The purpose of the Lab was to output a statement of your sandwich with giving the ingredients in the command line. This lab taught us how to use the command line statements and include them in the responses we were giving out as a sandwich.

* Lab 11

	Lab 11 part 2, was a very difficult lab for me at the time because of how many if statements there were paired with do and while loops which made it even more difficult. The purpose of the Lab was a guessing game where player 1 chose a number and player 2 would have 2 tries to guess the number with a given higher or lower given on the 1 try if failed. The difficulty of this lab came when it was time to code in order analyze the number and be able to recognize whether the number matched or not but because of the failure it was a very big relief when it did work. I enjoyed this lab because of the outcome I had with the code, it was a fun game to play that i showed to friends which is what I found fun out of it
